## About Me

I am a Software Developer who graduated from STI College Sta. Mesa.

## About This Website

I started this blog website because I wanted to share my ideas, experiences, and perspectives with different kinds things to others. I also wanted to combine my skills in writing with programming.
A place where I can improve both of my skills at the same time. This website became an opportunity to be one of my creative outlets as I add new features and add new blogs.

I don't plan on limiting my self to post any particular topic. I simply wish to express my self in a more organized and refined way. That means what I write is simply my opinion, to share to whomever may encounter it.
